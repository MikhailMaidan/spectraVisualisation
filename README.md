Title: Data Processing and Visualization Script for Spectral Analysis

Abstract:
This script is designed to process and analyze spectral data from multiple text files. It reads the data from the text files, merges the information into a pandas DataFrame, calculates the average for each spectrum, and saves the merged data to an Excel (.xlsx) file. Additionally, the script generates two plots using matplotlib, visualizing the spectra with different X-ranges, and saves both plots as a combined image in PNG format. The script provides an efficient and automated method for researchers and scientists to analyze and visualize spectroscopic data.

Introduction:
Spectroscopy is a fundamental technique used to study the interaction between matter and electromagnetic radiation. It provides valuable insights into the structural and chemical composition of substances. Handling spectral data from different experiments or samples often requires data merging, averaging, and visualization, which can be time-consuming and error-prone when performed manually. To address these challenges, this script was developed to streamline the data processing and visualization tasks, making it easier for researchers to gain meaningful insights from their spectroscopic datasets.

Methods:

Data Retrieval:
The script starts by importing essential Python libraries, including os, pandas, and matplotlib.pyplot. The os library is utilized to handle file paths, and the pandas library enables the efficient manipulation of data as DataFrames. The matplotlib.pyplot library is used for generating visualizations.

Data Loading and Merging:
The script defines two functions, read_first_column and read_second_column, which read the first and second columns from a given text file, respectively. These functions return the data as pandas Series. The script then iterates through the list of text files in the specified folder, reading their contents and merging them into a single DataFrame named merged_df. Each column in the DataFrame corresponds to the second column of the individual text files.

Average Calculation:
After merging the data, the script calculates the average for each row in the DataFrame, representing the averaged spectral intensities across the spectra. The average values are stored in a new column named "Average."

Data Saving:
The script saves the merged DataFrame, including the average column, to an Excel (.xlsx) file named "Glucose.xlsx." This facilitates data sharing and further analysis using spreadsheet software.

Visualization:
Using matplotlib, the script generates two plots for the spectra data. The first plot displays the full X-range spectra for all text files, while the second plot visualizes the spectra within a limited X-range (1000 to 1900). Both plots are combined into a single figure for easy comparison. The figure is saved as a PNG image named "Glucose.png."

Results:
The script successfully processes and analyzes spectral data from multiple text files. The merged DataFrame allows researchers to access and manipulate the data easily. Moreover, the calculated average column provides an overview of the collective spectral behavior. The plots offer visual representations of the spectra, aiding in identifying trends and patterns across the dataset. The saved Excel file and PNG image serve as valuable resources for reporting and sharing findings.

Conclusion:
This Python script provides a robust and automated solution for scientists and researchers working with spectroscopic data. By efficiently merging, averaging, and visualizing spectra, the script simplifies the data analysis process and enhances the understanding of the underlying phenomena. Its versatility and user-friendliness make it a valuable tool for a wide range of scientific disciplines relying on spectroscopy for investigations.
